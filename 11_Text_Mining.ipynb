I started using the phone in the full performance mode under battery settings to see the experience.. I would say this is the best way to get the complete experience of the full potential of the Snapdragon 8Gen1.. I know the ultimate battery life will be less than the balance mode however the difference is not big!.. Also with its full potential the phone is just absolutely stutter free n just flows no matter what you do!.. So suggest the readers to try it out to see how it feels for yourself..<br/><br/>The big update is I have ordered the new Xiaomi 13 Pro in mi.com and I am happy/ sad to say this is my last post here as I am exchanging my Xiaomi 12 Pro for the new phone.. I'm so excited to experience the new monster while I'm sad to let go off this beauty the Xiaomi 12 Pro ❤.. Easily the best phone I have owned ever in my life so far!.. Just love the Xiaomi flagships and I hope the experience remains so in the future..<br/><br/>I wish all the best to new Xiaomi 12 Pro buyers and my ownership review should help you give confidence to own this beauty at now revised 2023 price of just 50K!.. Over &amp; Out 👍<br/><br/>Feb 14th:-<br/>The phone's UI feels so much smoother now!.. The memory management has improved vastly &amp; battery life has improved significantly too!!.. Thanks to MiUi 14 (Android 13) improvements.. There are minor bugs nevertheless with Screen recording option disappearing all of sudden from yesterday!.. Certain settings under developer options changing by itself etc.. But these are very minor issues to worry about..<br/><br/>Feb 11th:-<br/>Got Android 13 based MiUi14 on my phone finally!!.. Comes with Jan 2023 Android security patch.. The phone instantly feels butter smooth!!.. wooh!.. Attached screenshot of the Android version..<br/><br/>Jan 6th:-<br/>Yet to get any security patch after Sep 2022!.. It has been 4 months since now.. I'm disappointed frankly in terms of updates.. I understand that the phone is due &amp; should be amongst 1st to get Android 13 based MiUI 14 to arrive anytime now.. But that is not an excuse to not provide this long!.. I expected a Dec 2022 update atleast by now..<br/><br/>In terms of battery there has been a decline in backup esp when on mobile data.. Thanks to 5G network now.. For whatever reason the auto brightness of the phone is continuously very high than what is required (adding to average battery performance).. There has been a few stutters in the UI I'm noticing which could be again related to lack of updates!.. Also I notice very aggressive RAM management performance where certain apps get killed immediately as soon as I get out of it!.. Possibly it's got to do with MiUI's irritating battery saving attempt..<br/><br/>Anyways hoping for some improvements in my next update.. Fingers crossed..<br/><br/>Nov 27th:-<br/>Got my vodafone primary sim ported to Airtel &amp; have Jio as my secondary sim.. Both are giving me 5g internet with Jio giving consistently more 5g connectivity than Airtel. The Phone is blazing fast now in terms of browsing &amp; YouTube etc.. Attaching some screen for 5g performance of the phone!..<br/><br/>Oct 19th:-<br/>Got an update to enable 5g services for the phone. Under settings though I don't see any changes.<br/><br/>Had been to Kashmir vacation where the phone was used fully.. The battery loss was quiet significant outdoors on mobile data with 2 sim cards.. The main reason for it is it's display that's almost at full brightness in auto mode.. Also due to poor signals in Kashmir, the phone is continously working to look for a stable mobile network.. The photos came out fantastic for it's segment &amp; I was comparing it against iPhone 13 Mini/ iPhone 12 Pro/ iPhone 12/ S20 FE 5G of my cousins.. A lot of times my cousins preferred me to take the main cam shots from Xiaomi 12 Pro over others!.. The selfie performance was average at best though.. The telephoto/ zoom performance was toe to toe with iPhone 12 Pro in both photos &amp; videos!!.. Coming to the most controversial video shooting performance, most of the videos ranging from 30 secs to nearly 10 mins in the most unique HDR10+ quality came out fabulous!!.. The video quality was not comparable to iPhone 12 Pro/ 13 as soon as the natural lights came down though.. The iPhones showed their superiority clearly in low light/ sunset videos..<br/><br/>Will keep updating my experience further as days go..<br/><br/>Oct 9th:-<br/>Have got September security patch. The routine is one security patch every 2-3 months typical of Xiaomi.. The update had nothing else other than security patch in it..<br/>The phone is otherwise performing same n is top notch &amp; Im extremely happy with the device..<br/><br/>Sep 17th:-<br/>Performance of the phone has improved now!.. Xiaomi has done some magic.. Even the phones highest cpu temperature against any load is only 60 degrees as against 75 degrees before!<br/><br/>Attaching new benchmark app results..<br/><br/>Aug 29th:-<br/>Attaching some screenshots from my phone for all the battery life cribbers &amp; potential customers &amp; interested fellows..<br/><br/>I got a Screen On Time (SOT) of over 7:30 hours today!!!.. See for yourself before judging the battery life of Xiaomi 12 Pro.. I have also attached a set of screenshots from my phone settings that affect battery life..<br/><br/>Always give time to your phone &amp; the advanced AI in it to start reading what kind of user it is working with!.. My phone is 20+ days old now &amp; it has learnt how I use my phone &amp; how to optimise it.. So dont jump to conclusions by looking at your phone in hours!!..<br/><br/>My phone today was used indoors mainly with mostly on Wifi but has 2 SIMs in it.. Bluetooth on for occasional smartphone connectivity &amp; other settings in the screenshot.. Also reiterating that the phone has very good standby battery time too even with Always On Display..<br/><br/>Aug 25th:-<br/><br/>Attaching 4K@60fps video of 2 mins length.. I tried attaching 5 mins video I shot but Amazon says the file is too big to be attached!.. So I can't upload the 5 mins video.. What I can confirm though is no camera fogging visible anymore in the rear sensor.. Nor is the video shootage (both videos) had any fogging visible at all!!.. Remember we are talking about a phone that had it originally..<br/><br/>After 5+2 mins of 4K@60fps, the phone was warm.. The battery temperature showed 45 degrees max.. Just FYI..<br/><br/>Aug 24th:-<br/><br/>I see a lot of customers are unhappy with the phone after purchasing as there is fog in the rear camera. They rate the phone 1 star &amp; want to return it.. It's their wish as it's their product/ money..<br/><br/>But I had a suggestion to kind off resolve this issue as I have done for my phone.. I made 2 videos today to test the situation.. 5 mins 4K@60fps videos each from the main rear sensor.. I had no fogging issues to note!!.. Just to remind the readers, my phone also had camera fogging issue while shooting videos from the main cam in the past (have made a note of it in my review below for reference)..<br/><br/>So what did I do to resolve the issue.. Just shoot 5 mins length 4K@60fps videos from the main camera.. Shoot 10 videos back to back of 5 mins length in the same resolution.. The phone will heat up badly.. Let it heat up.. Once done shooting 10 videos.. Come out of the camera app &amp; leave the phone to cool down.. Don't bother shooting a video to test anymore.. Give it 1 days time &amp; meanwhile use your phone normally for any other function.. Test the video the next day &amp; check whether the issue persists.. If it still does, you can return the product.. Otherwise all well &amp; good.. I lost both 5 mins videos I shot this evening.. I will update a 5 mins video in a day or 2 for you to see the video quality yourself n whether there's any foggy tone in the video..<br/><br/>Aug 20th:-<br/><br/>Bought Xiaomi 12 Pro for 50K on Aug 7th in sale after card &amp; coupon discounts.. Below is my experience so far in these 12 days;-<br/><br/>Like to start with the display which is the best part about the phone.. This is one of the best ever screens on any smartphone ever!!.. A curved display that is 6.73\" E5 Amoled that is 120hz, LTPO 2, 10 Bit, QHD+, Dolby Vision, with 1050 nits max brightness (gsmarena tested) screen.. That has wonderful viewing angles, absolutely stunning hardware with no screen leak or dirty screen effects like it's competitors' inconsistent/ poor QCd units!.. Absolute ❤.. A few cons that I noticed though is the phone has more accidental touch issue due to curved screen than say my previous phones iQOO 9Pro &amp; Samsung Note20Ultra.. Also the phone doesn't come with a pre applied screen protector.. Had to get a good quality screen protector for 1000 rupees..<br/><br/>Nextly the speakers &amp; audio quality.. It's got Harmon Kardon tuned quad speakers (2 woofers + 2 tweeters), with 2 dedicated outlets, that is excellent.. Yes, it's not the loudest esp when compared to iphones &amp; Samsung flagships &amp; Oneplus flagships.. But the quad speakers show their speciality with a full range of sound &amp; with it's richness during any kind of audio output.. Compared the audio with my wife's iPhone 12 (as good as any iphone 13 series) &amp; that's where I make these observations.. Also I've owned Samsung flagships in the past to add on to the experience..<br/><br/>Design &amp; Build wise.. the phone is of the highest order possible with excellent design &amp; color options along with a solid/ very stylish metal frame that syncs with Gorilla Glass Victus display on the front &amp; Gorilla Glass 5 glass on the hind.. The bezels in the top &amp; bottom isn't the snallest of all though n the curve at the edges could be more boxy for my liking than the current design that's more roundish.. All in all the phone syncs overall with the Purple hue beautifully to make it a piece of art!.. The only sore miss is an IP68 rating sadly..<br/><br/>MiUi 13 on the phone is running July 2022 security update &amp; the UI is polished &amp; has excellent animations n look n feel!.. I have used phones with One UI, Color OS, Realme UI, Funtouch OS, iOS, Stock Androids (never used Oxygen OS though).. My most favorite UI for style n look n animations &amp; feel has to be MiUI amongst all!.. The sheer array of Wallpapers (incl free Live Wallpapers), Themes, Fonts that's available for free is unbelievably good n incomparable!!.. The way the haptics have been integrated into the UI is best of all to add on.. The haptic motor is amongst the best too!.. All is not roses for MiUI though with slightly lower stability in terms of smoothness &amp; consistency when compared to Color OS &amp; One UI which are butter smooth.. The battery &amp; general optimization is very well done though.. There were about 5-6 unwanted apps out of the box but most were straight uninstall while a few others I could remove using the adb function.. Overall very happy with the software experience so far.. Also adding on is a promise of 3 Major Android  updates until Android 15 &amp; security patches for 4 years!.. What is to be noted is Xiaomi doesn't provide prompt monthly updates.. It is only periodic like say once in 2 to 4 months which is not great..<br/><br/>Call quality over ear piece &amp; mic &amp; speaker is excellent.. The signal reception for sim card of various vendors - Vodafone/ Airtel/ Jio is all fine with very rare issues (I blame it to poor service than phone).. Wifi performance is fabulous with the best mobile modem attached to Snapdragon 8Gen1.. Bluetooth connectivity, NFC n all other modes of connectivity are top notch.. So very happy with these most primary functions on any phone..<br/><br/>Cameras wise the highlight is the primary rear custom made 50MP sensor Sony IMX707 which is fantastic in literally every condition for photography!.. It has 1 big issue that has to be addressed though.. The rear primary camera fogging while shooting video for anything more than 1.5 mins.. But this rear camera fogging isn't consistent &amp; sometimes it doesnt do it n fine too inbetween!.. But it's inconsistent for it's unpredictable performance.. The Ultrawide &amp; Telephoto/ Portrait cameras consist of 2 50MP Samsung JN1 sensors respectively.. This is an excellent setup &amp; they work very well for most functions.. The Telephoto/ Portrait cam has only 2X Optical zoom but that's a good enough feature with sharp &amp; pleasing zoom pics.. The Telephoto cam lacks OIS which is a miss according to me &amp; wouldve helped in low light zoom.. Similarly the Ultrawide cam lacks Autofocus &amp; that doesn't make it a Macro cam which is sad.. All 3 rear cams can shoot good quality 4K@60fps videos with excellent stability!.. The night time photo/ video shooting is also top notch thanks to excellent implementation of bright flash with good flash timing &amp; length to assist.. Overall very capable rear cameras.. Selfie cam wise it's a 32MP Omnivision sensor which isn't great hardware wise.. I would've wished a top Sony sensor instead.. The dynamic range of the selfie is very limited.. The phone takes a full 32MP snap &amp; isn't pixel binned yet the sharpness isn't great n the photos come out slightly soft.. Yet Xiaomi's excellent post processing capabilities make the selfie cam Above Average overall for stills.. Night mode in selfie helps brighten the screen for additional light while autofocus assistance by the AI system for selfie helps a great deal overall.. Selfie video shooting is capped at 1080p@60fps resolution at max but has very good stability due to EIS.. Overall a very good camera experience considering I'm not too much of a video shooter..<br/><br/>Battery backup has been good.. Yes I'm saying good unlike many in this forum.. The users should understand that the phone has an SOC thats amongst the fastest &amp; more powerful on the planet n a sportscar can never give you a commuter car's fuel efficiency!.. Well apart from this logic have attached a couple of screenshots where I have easily recorded over 6hrs of Screen On Time!.. This is with always only at 120hz + QHD+ + Other visual enhancement settings + Always on display all the time + Live Wallpaper + high haptics but with only dark mode &amp; Auto brightness enabled (Auto brightness is generally on high brightness most of the times).. The phone has excellent idle time battery optimization thanks to MiUI.. The 120 watts charger tops up the phone in quick time but has a USB Type A to Type C connectors.. It isn't say as fast charging as iQOO 9 Pro's more mordern Type C to Type C port that charges more faster.. Finally the heating aspect of the phone.. Please note that amongst the Snapdragon 8Gen1 phones like - Samsung S22 series, OnePlus 10Pro, iQOO 9Pro, Realme GT2 etc.. Only Xiaomi 12 Pro has unrestricted 8Gen1 speed (ie not downclocking the chipset in the fear of overheating).. The phone consistently scores above 9 lacs in Antutu with CPU score of over 2 lacs no matter any condition unlike all of it's competitors!.. The others have downclocked their chipsets to control overheating.. What this means is Yes the chipset is notorious for overheating when stressed.. I have seen a max of 75 degrees celcius of CPU &amp; 50 degrees of battery Temperature when pushed to it's extreme in Antutu test.. Also when I shot multiple 4K videos of 5 mins length for more than 30 mins at a stretch, got a message saying the phone has overheated &amp; give it a break.. So yes the phone has overheating issue but again only when pushed to heavy duty.. Otherwise for regular operation it is fine.. Runs at a CPU temperature ranging from 40 to 50 degrees &amp; battery from 32 to 42 degrees which is normal..<br/><br/>The fingerprint sensor is a regular optical unit.. It is nowhere near as fascinating/ secure/ fast as iQOO 9 Pro's 3D Ultrasonic unit that's just the best ever!..<br/><br/>On the whole at 50K there cannot be a better smartphone than this ever!.. Really happy with the phone also considering it's cons..<br/><br/>I whole heartedly recommend this phone to all until you are a frequent video shooter &amp; a gamer (overheating issue)..</span></div></div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header readMore\">\n",

(Looses 8-15% at night, when always on display is off, vibration is off, mobile data/WiFi is off)<br/>[Update September 2022: With latest software updates, battery drain when idle seems to have resolved to some extent. Also, there is no performance sacrifices for this. So, now I wouldn't consider battery drain a huge negative point, as the charging is really fast]<br/><br/>Also, even for for just casual usages there is slight heating issue, when outside temperature is 30-33°C (an average temperature in India; For those in cold places, there are issues too... keep reading!)<br/><br/>On gaming, it throttles a lot along with overheating at times, maybe given performance equivalent to Snapdragon 855 or 845, when heated up! Maybe going with Mi 11 Ultra would be a better choice, or go for 8Gen1 devices from other companies or wait for 8Gen1+! I really regret the decision to buy this phone, been using it for 1 week now!!!<br/><br/>I have been using Xiaomi products for many years, and decided to believe and buy a flagship from this company. But so far the experience is disappointing, and gives a midrange feel in many areas...<br/><br/> Over heating when used outside, for just regular usages, like Gmail, browsing the internet, Amazon etc...<br/><br/> Also, though the charging is fast, the battery drain is fast too...<br/><br/>And the camera needs a lot of optimization. Daylight photos, many times it's over exposed and over saturated and cases can be reddish. And HDR doesn't always work well. Its sometimes a disappointing performance, considering its supposed to be a flagship camera! Even that can be fixed by a software update...<br/>And maybe a good Gcam port is all I can hope for, if someone makes it, as i don't have much hope from Xiaomi...<br/><br/> But surely there are hardware issues too...<br/>Overheating is surely somewhat an hardware issue, given the negative feedback of 8Gen1...<br/>But the implementation in Mi 12 pro, seems so poor, and it makes things worse. It's advertising industry leading cooling systems, but performance isn't reflecting it!<br/><br/>Also, i recently went to a hill station(temperature was 13-20°C) and on trying the camera there, the phone heats up even there on using camera for few minutes, and fog got formed in the internal camera lens of the main camera unit, which is quite disappointing!  (Note: it's not outside the camera, that it can be wiped, but inside the camera.<br/>And saw in online forums and YouTube that it's a general issue with this model, especially the Chinese and Indian ones! Search and you can find the issue)<br/><br/>Hope the device doesn't get under-clocked, because I and most people who opt for a flagship care about high end performance.<br/><br/>So Xiaomi, if you are reading this, we all hope, an alternative fix for overheating can be implemented with software that doesn't involve sacrificing the performance of 8Gen1!<br/><br/> I will wait and see how Xiaomi takes feedback and fixes these issues(I have filled feedback using the feature provided within the phone)...<br/><br/>I am not even sure if customer feedback is even considered and I am doubting the trust and decision of buying a premium phone from Xiaomi...<br/><br/>On a positive note, the screen is excellent, main camera module is great in low light (though there are hiccups at times), also zoom camera isn't great, given its a 2x telephoto!<br/>The IR blaster, is a nice to have. Also it checks most of the features that is expected in a flagship. But it doesn't have an official IP rating, though they say its built to be IP 53 compliant. But flagships should be having IP 68.<br/><br/>Performance is smooth, which is expected, but there are software glitches at times, and the issue of overheating and battery drain! As the battery keeps draining fast, and if we keep charging with 120W, battery life is a question... Don't think it will last much long!<br/><br/>The charger is insane, but heavy and not very travel friendly....  And claimed charging speed of 18 mins isn't achievable unless phone doesn't heat up, which isn't possible unless you give it active cooling while charging!<br/>Realistically you get from 0-100% in 25-30 mins!</span></div></div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header readMore\">\n",

       "<span> Mar 6th:-<br/>The phone is performing very well after the last update. I started using the phone in the full performance mode under battery settings to see the experience.. I would say this is the best way to get the complete experience of the full potential of the Snapdragon 8Gen1.. I know the ultimate battery life will be less than the balance mode however the difference is not big!.. Also with its full potential the phone is just absolutely stutter free n just flows no matter what you do!.. So suggest the readers to try it out to see how it feels for yourself..<br/><br/>The big update is I have ordered the new Xiaomi 13 Pro in mi.com and I am happy/ sad to say this is my last post here as I am exchanging my Xiaomi 12 Pro for the new phone.. I'm so excited to experience the new monster while I'm sad to let go off this beauty the Xiaomi 12 Pro ❤.. Easily the best phone I have owned ever in my life so far!.. Just love the Xiaomi flagships and I hope the experience remains so in the future..<br/><br/>I wish all the best to new Xiaomi 12 Pro buyers and my ownership review should help you give confidence to own this beauty at now revised 2023 price of just 50K!.. Over &amp; Out 👍<br/><br/>Feb 14th:-<br/>The phone's UI feels so much smoother now!.. The memory management has improved vastly &amp; battery life has improved significantly too!!.. Thanks to MiUi 14 (Android 13) improvements.. There are minor bugs nevertheless with Screen recording option disappearing all of sudden from yesterday!.. Certain settings under developer options changing by itself etc.. But these are very minor issues to worry about..<br/><br/>Feb 11th:-<br/>Got Android 13 based MiUi14 on my phone finally!!.. Comes with Jan 2023 Android security patch.. The phone instantly feels butter smooth!!.. wooh!.. Attached screenshot of the Android version..<br/><br/>Jan 6th:-<br/>Yet to get any security patch after Sep 2022!.. It has been 4 months since now.. I'm disappointed frankly in terms of updates.. I understand that the phone is due &amp; should be amongst 1st to get Android 13 based MiUI 14 to arrive anytime now.. But that is not an excuse to not provide this long!.. I expected a Dec 2022 update atleast by now..<br/><br/>In terms of battery there has been a decline in backup esp when on mobile data.. Thanks to 5G network now.. For whatever reason the auto brightness of the phone is continuously very high than what is required (adding to average battery performance).. There has been a few stutters in the UI I'm noticing which could be again related to lack of updates!.. Also I notice very aggressive RAM management performance where certain apps get killed immediately as soon as I get out of it!.. Possibly it's got to do with MiUI's irritating battery saving attempt..<br/><br/>Anyways hoping for some improvements in my next update.. Fingers crossed..<br/><br/>Nov 27th:-<br/>Got my vodafone primary sim ported to Airtel &amp; have Jio as my secondary sim.. Both are giving me 5g internet with Jio giving consistently more 5g connectivity than Airtel. The Phone is blazing fast now in terms of browsing &amp; YouTube etc.. Attaching some screen for 5g performance of the phone!..<br/><br/>Oct 19th:-<br/>Got an update to enable 5g services for the phone. Under settings though I don't see any changes.<br/><br/>Had been to Kashmir vacation where the phone was used fully.. The battery loss was quiet significant outdoors on mobile data with 2 sim cards.. The main reason for it is it's display that's almost at full brightness in auto mode.. Also due to poor signals in Kashmir, the phone is continously working to look for a stable mobile network.. The photos came out fantastic for it's segment &amp; I was comparing it against iPhone 13 Mini/ iPhone 12 Pro/ iPhone 12/ S20 FE 5G of my cousins.. A lot of times my cousins preferred me to take the main cam shots from Xiaomi 12 Pro over others!.. The selfie performance was average at best though.. The telephoto/ zoom performance was toe to toe with iPhone 12 Pro in both photos &amp; videos!!.. Coming to the most controversial video shooting performance, most of the videos ranging from 30 secs to nearly 10 mins in the most unique HDR10+ quality came out fabulous!!.. The video quality was not comparable to iPhone 12 Pro/ 13 as soon as the natural lights came down though.. The iPhones showed their superiority clearly in low light/ sunset videos..<br/><br/>Will keep updating my experience further as days go..<br/><br/>Oct 9th:-<br/>Have got September security patch. The routine is one security patch every 2-3 months typical of Xiaomi.. The update had nothing else other than security patch in it..<br/>The phone is otherwise performing same n is top notch &amp; Im extremely happy with the device..<br/><br/>Sep 17th:-<br/>Performance of the phone has improved now!.. Xiaomi has done some magic.. Even the phones highest cpu temperature against any load is only 60 degrees as against 75 degrees before!<br/><br/>Attaching new benchmark app results..<br/><br/>Aug 29th:-<br/>Attaching some screenshots from my phone for all the battery life cribbers &amp; potential customers &amp; interested fellows..<br/><br/>I got a Screen On Time (SOT) of over 7:30 hours today!!!.. See for yourself before judging the battery life of Xiaomi 12 Pro.. I have also attached a set of screenshots from my phone settings that affect battery life..<br/><br/>Always give time to your phone &amp; the advanced AI in it to start reading what kind of user it is working with!.. My phone is 20+ days old now &amp; it has learnt how I use my phone &amp; how to optimise it.. So dont jump to conclusions by looking at your phone in hours!!..<br/><br/>My phone today was used indoors mainly with mostly on Wifi but has 2 SIMs in it.. Bluetooth on for occasional smartphone connectivity &amp; other settings in the screenshot.. Also reiterating that the phone has very good standby battery time too even with Always On Display..<br/><br/>Aug 25th:-<br/><br/>Attaching 4K@60fps video of 2 mins length.. I tried attaching 5 mins video I shot but Amazon says the file is too big to be attached!.. So I can't upload the 5 mins video.. What I can confirm though is no camera fogging visible anymore in the rear sensor.. Nor is the video shootage (both videos) had any fogging visible at all!!.. Remember we are talking about a phone that had it originally..<br/><br/>After 5+2 mins of 4K@60fps, the phone was warm.. The battery temperature showed 45 degrees max.. Just FYI..<br/><br/>Aug 24th:-<br/><br/>I see a lot of customers are unhappy with the phone after purchasing as there is fog in the rear camera. They rate the phone 1 star &amp; want to return it.. It's their wish as it's their product/ money..<br/><br/>But I had a suggestion to kind off resolve this issue as I have done for my phone.. I made 2 videos today to test the situation.. 5 mins 4K@60fps videos each from the main rear sensor.. I had no fogging issues to note!!.. Just to remind the readers, my phone also had camera fogging issue while shooting videos from the main cam in the past (have made a note of it in my review below for reference)..<br/><br/>So what did I do to resolve the issue.. Just shoot 5 mins length 4K@60fps videos from the main camera.. Shoot 10 videos back to back of 5 mins length in the same resolution.. The phone will heat up badly.. Let it heat up.. Once done shooting 10 videos.. Come out of the camera app &amp; leave the phone to cool down.. Don't bother shooting a video to test anymore.. Give it 1 days time &amp; meanwhile use your phone normally for any other function.. Test the video the next day &amp; check whether the issue persists.. If it still does, you can return the product.. Otherwise all well &amp; good.. I lost both 5 mins videos I shot this evening.. I will update a 5 mins video in a day or 2 for you to see the video quality yourself n whether there's any foggy tone in the video..<br/><br/>Aug 20th:-<br/><br/>Bought Xiaomi 12 Pro for 50K on Aug 7th in sale after card &amp; coupon discounts.. Below is my experience so far in these 12 days;-<br/><br/>Like to start with the display which is the best part about the phone.. This is one of the best ever screens on any smartphone ever!!.. A curved display that is 6.73\" E5 Amoled that is 120hz, LTPO 2, 10 Bit, QHD+, Dolby Vision, with 1050 nits max brightness (gsmarena tested) screen.. That has wonderful viewing angles, absolutely stunning hardware with no screen leak or dirty screen effects like it's competitors' inconsistent/ poor QCd units!.. Absolute ❤.. A few cons that I noticed though is the phone has more accidental touch issue due to curved screen than say my previous phones iQOO 9Pro &amp; Samsung Note20Ultra.. Also the phone doesn't come with a pre applied screen protector.. Had to get a good quality screen protector for 1000 rupees..<br/><br/>Nextly the speakers &amp; audio quality.. It's got Harmon Kardon tuned quad speakers (2 woofers + 2 tweeters), with 2 dedicated outlets, that is excellent.. Yes, it's not the loudest esp when compared to iphones &amp; Samsung flagships &amp; Oneplus flagships.. But the quad speakers show their speciality with a full range of sound &amp; with it's richness during any kind of audio output.. Compared the audio with my wife's iPhone 12 (as good as any iphone 13 series) &amp; that's where I make these observations.. Also I've owned Samsung flagships in the past to add on to the experience..<br/><br/>Design &amp; Build wise.. the phone is of the highest order possible with excellent design &amp; color options along with a solid/ very stylish metal frame that syncs with Gorilla Glass Victus display on the front &amp; Gorilla Glass 5 glass on the hind.. The bezels in the top &amp; bottom isn't the snallest of all though n the curve at the edges could be more boxy for my liking than the current design that's more roundish.. All in all the phone syncs overall with the Purple hue beautifully to make it a piece of art!.. The only sore miss is an IP68 rating sadly..<br/><br/>MiUi 13 on the phone is running July 2022 security update &amp; the UI is polished &amp; has excellent animations n look n feel!.. I have used phones with One UI, Color OS, Realme UI, Funtouch OS, iOS, Stock Androids (never used Oxygen OS though).. My most favorite UI for style n look n animations &amp; feel has to be MiUI amongst all!.. The sheer array of Wallpapers (incl free Live Wallpapers), Themes, Fonts that's available for free is unbelievably good n incomparable!!.. The way the haptics have been integrated into the UI is best of all to add on.. The haptic motor is amongst the best too!.. All is not roses for MiUI though with slightly lower stability in terms of smoothness &amp; consistency when compared to Color OS &amp; One UI which are butter smooth.. The battery &amp; general optimization is very well done though.. There were about 5-6 unwanted apps out of the box but most were straight uninstall while a few others I could remove using the adb function.. Overall very happy with the software experience so far.. Also adding on is a promise of 3 Major Android  updates until Android 15 &amp; security patches for 4 years!.. What is to be noted is Xiaomi doesn't provide prompt monthly updates.. It is only periodic like say once in 2 to 4 months which is not great..<br/><br/>Call quality over ear piece &amp; mic &amp; speaker is excellent.. The signal reception for sim card of various vendors - Vodafone/ Airtel/ Jio is all fine with very rare issues (I blame it to poor service than phone).. Wifi performance is fabulous with the best mobile modem attached to Snapdragon 8Gen1.. Bluetooth connectivity, NFC n all other modes of connectivity are top notch.. So very happy with these most primary functions on any phone..<br/><br/>Cameras wise the highlight is the primary rear custom made 50MP sensor Sony IMX707 which is fantastic in literally every condition for photography!.. It has 1 big issue that has to be addressed though.. The rear primary camera fogging while shooting video for anything more than 1.5 mins.. But this rear camera fogging isn't consistent &amp; sometimes it doesnt do it n fine too inbetween!.. But it's inconsistent for it's unpredictable performance.. The Ultrawide &amp; Telephoto/ Portrait cameras consist of 2 50MP Samsung JN1 sensors respectively.. This is an excellent setup &amp; they work very well for most functions.. The Telephoto/ Portrait cam has only 2X Optical zoom but that's a good enough feature with sharp &amp; pleasing zoom pics.. The Telephoto cam lacks OIS which is a miss according to me &amp; wouldve helped in low light zoom.. Similarly the Ultrawide cam lacks Autofocus &amp; that doesn't make it a Macro cam which is sad.. All 3 rear cams can shoot good quality 4K@60fps videos with excellent stability!.. The night time photo/ video shooting is also top notch thanks to excellent implementation of bright flash with good flash timing &amp; length to assist.. Overall very capable rear cameras.. Selfie cam wise it's a 32MP Omnivision sensor which isn't great hardware wise.. I would've wished a top Sony sensor instead.. The dynamic range of the selfie is very limited.. The phone takes a full 32MP snap &amp; isn't pixel binned yet the sharpness isn't great n the photos come out slightly soft.. Yet Xiaomi's excellent post processing capabilities make the selfie cam Above Average overall for stills.. Night mode in selfie helps brighten the screen for additional light while autofocus assistance by the AI system for selfie helps a great deal overall.. Selfie video shooting is capped at 1080p@60fps resolution at max but has very good stability due to EIS.. Overall a very good camera experience considering I'm not too much of a video shooter..<br/><br/>Battery backup has been good.. Yes I'm saying good unlike many in this forum.. The users should understand that the phone has an SOC thats amongst the fastest &amp; more powerful on the planet n a sportscar can never give you a commuter car's fuel efficiency!.. Well apart from this logic have attached a couple of screenshots where I have easily recorded over 6hrs of Screen On Time!.. This is with always only at 120hz + QHD+ + Other visual enhancement settings + Always on display all the time + Live Wallpaper + high haptics but with only dark mode &amp; Auto brightness enabled (Auto brightness is generally on high brightness most of the times).. The phone has excellent idle time battery optimization thanks to MiUI.. The 120 watts charger tops up the phone in quick time but has a USB Type A to Type C connectors.. It isn't say as fast charging as iQOO 9 Pro's more mordern Type C to Type C port that charges more faster.. Finally the heating aspect of the phone.. Please note that amongst the Snapdragon 8Gen1 phones like - Samsung S22 series, OnePlus 10Pro, iQOO 9Pro, Realme GT2 etc.. Only Xiaomi 12 Pro has unrestricted 8Gen1 speed (ie not downclocking the chipset in the fear of overheating).. The phone consistently scores above 9 lacs in Antutu with CPU score of over 2 lacs no matter any condition unlike all of it's competitors!.. The others have downclocked their chipsets to control overheating.. What this means is Yes the chipset is notorious for overheating when stressed.. I have seen a max of 75 degrees celcius of CPU &amp; 50 degrees of battery Temperature when pushed to it's extreme in Antutu test.. Also when I shot multiple 4K videos of 5 mins length for more than 30 mins at a stretch, got a message saying the phone has overheated &amp; give it a break.. So yes the phone has overheating issue but again only when pushed to heavy duty.. Otherwise for regular operation it is fine.. Runs at a CPU temperature ranging from 40 to 50 degrees &amp; battery from 32 to 42 degrees which is normal..<br/><br/>The fingerprint sensor is a regular optical unit.. It is nowhere near as fascinating/ secure/ fast as iQOO 9 Pro's 3D Ultrasonic unit that's just the best ever!..<br/><br/>On the whole at 50K there cannot be a better smartphone than this ever!.. Really happy with the phone also considering it's cons..<br/><br/>I whole heartedly recommend this phone to all until you are a frequent video shooter &amp; a gamer (overheating issue)..</span>\n",

       "            Mar 6th:-<br>The phone is performing very well after the last update. I started using the phone in the full performance mode under battery settings to see the experience.. I would say this is the best way to get the complete experience of the full potential of the Snapdragon 8Gen1.. I know the ultimate battery life will be less than the balance mode however the difference is not big!.. Also with its full potential the phone is just absolutely stutter free n just flows no matter what you do!.. So suggest the readers to try it out to see how it feels for yourself..<br/><br/>The big update is I have ordered the new Xiaomi 13 Pro in mi.com and I am happy/ sad to say this is my last post here as I am exchanging my Xiaomi 12 Pro for the new phone.. I'm so excited to experience the new monster while I'm sad to let go off this beauty the Xiaomi 12 Pro ❤.. Easily the best phone I have owned ever in my life so far!.. Just love the Xiaomi flagships and I hope the experience remains so in the future..<br/><br/>I wish all the best to new Xiaomi 12 Pro buyers and my ownership review should help you give confidence to own this beauty at now revised 2023 price of just 50K!.. Over &amp; Out 👍<br/><br/>Feb 14th:-<br/>The phone's UI feels so much smoother now!.. The memory management has improved vastly &amp; battery life has improved significantly too!!.. Thanks to MiUi 14 (Android 13) improvements.. There are minor bugs nevertheless with Screen recording option disappearing all of sudden from yesterday!.. Certain settings under developer options changing by itself etc.. But these are very minor issues to worry about..<br/><br/>Feb 11th:-<br/>Got Android 13 based MiUi14 on my phone finally!!.. Comes with Jan 2023 Android security patch.. The phone instantly feels butter smooth!!.. wooh!.. Attached screenshot of the Android version..<br/><br/>Jan 6th:-<br/>Yet to get any security patch after Sep 2022!.. It has been 4 months since now.. I'm disappointed frankly in terms of updates.. I understand that the phone is due &amp; should be amongst 1st to get Android 13 based MiUI 14 to arrive anytime now.. But that is not an excuse to not provide this long!.. I expected a Dec 2022 update atleast by now..<br/><br/>In terms of battery there has been a decline in backup esp when on mobile data.. Thanks to 5G network now.. For whatever reason the auto brightness of the phone is continuously very high than what is required (adding to average battery performance).. There has been a few stutters in the UI I'm noticing which could be again related to lack of updates!.. Also I notice very aggressive RAM management performance where certain apps get killed immediately as soon as I get out of it!.. Possibly it's got to do with MiUI's irritating battery saving attempt..<br/><br/>Anyways hoping for some improvements in my next update.. Fingers crossed..<br/><br/>Nov 27th:-<br/>Got my vodafone primary sim ported to Airtel &amp; have Jio as my secondary sim.. Both are giving me 5g internet with Jio giving consistently more 5g connectivity than Airtel. The Phone is blazing fast now in terms of browsing &amp; YouTube etc.. Attaching some screen for 5g performance of the phone!..<br/><br/>Oct 19th:-<br/>Got an update to enable 5g services for the phone. Under settings though I don't see any changes.<br/><br/>Had been to Kashmir vacation where the phone was used fully.. The battery loss was quiet significant outdoors on mobile data with 2 sim cards.. The main reason for it is it's display that's almost at full brightness in auto mode.. Also due to poor signals in Kashmir, the phone is continously working to look for a stable mobile network.. The photos came out fantastic for it's segment &amp; I was comparing it against iPhone 13 Mini/ iPhone 12 Pro/ iPhone 12/ S20 FE 5G of my cousins.. A lot of times my cousins preferred me to take the main cam shots from Xiaomi 12 Pro over others!.. The selfie performance was average at best though.. The telephoto/ zoom performance was toe to toe with iPhone 12 Pro in both photos &amp; videos!!.. Coming to the most controversial video shooting performance, most of the videos ranging from 30 secs to nearly 10 mins in the most unique HDR10+ quality came out fabulous!!.. The video quality was not comparable to iPhone 12 Pro/ 13 as soon as the natural lights came down though.. The iPhones showed their superiority clearly in low light/ sunset videos..<br/><br/>Will keep updating my experience further as days go..<br/><br/>Oct 9th:-<br/>Have got September security patch. The routine is one security patch every 2-3 months typical of Xiaomi.. The update had nothing else other than security patch in it..<br/>The phone is otherwise performing same n is top notch &amp; Im extremely happy with the device..<br/><br/>Sep 17th:-<br/>Performance of the phone has improved now!.. Xiaomi has done some magic.. Even the phones highest cpu temperature against any load is only 60 degrees as against 75 degrees before!<br/><br/>Attaching new benchmark app results..<br/><br/>Aug 29th:-<br/>Attaching some screenshots from my phone for all the battery life cribbers &amp; potential customers &amp; interested fellows..<br/><br/>I got a Screen On Time (SOT) of over 7:30 hours today!!!.. See for yourself before judging the battery life of Xiaomi 12 Pro.. I have also attached a set of screenshots from my phone settings that affect battery life..<br/><br/>Always give time to your phone &amp; the advanced AI in it to start reading what kind of user it is working with!.. My phone is 20+ days old now &amp; it has learnt how I use my phone &amp; how to optimise it.. So dont jump to conclusions by looking at your phone in hours!!..<br/><br/>My phone today was used indoors mainly with mostly on Wifi but has 2 SIMs in it.. Bluetooth on for occasional smartphone connectivity &amp; other settings in the screenshot.. Also reiterating that the phone has very good standby battery time too even with Always On Display..<br/><br/>Aug 25th:-<br/><br/>Attaching 4K@60fps video of 2 mins length.. I tried attaching 5 mins video I shot but Amazon says the file is too big to be attached!.. So I can't upload the 5 mins video.. What I can confirm though is no camera fogging visible anymore in the rear sensor.. Nor is the video shootage (both videos) had any fogging visible at all!!.. Remember we are talking about a phone that had it originally..<br/><br/>After 5+2 mins of 4K@60fps, the phone was warm.. The battery temperature showed 45 degrees max.. Just FYI..<br/><br/>Aug 24th:-<br/><br/>I see a lot of customers are unhappy with the phone after purchasing as there is fog in the rear camera. They rate the phone 1 star &amp; want to return it.. It's their wish as it's their product/ money..<br/><br/>But I had a suggestion to kind off resolve this issue as I have done for my phone.. I made 2 videos today to test the situation.. 5 mins 4K@60fps videos each from the main rear sensor.. I had no fogging issues to note!!.. Just to remind the readers, my phone also had camera fogging issue while shooting videos from the main cam in the past (have made a note of it in my review below for reference)..<br/><br/>So what did I do to resolve the issue.. Just shoot 5 mins length 4K@60fps videos from the main camera.. Shoot 10 videos back to back of 5 mins length in the same resolution.. The phone will heat up badly.. Let it heat up.. Once done shooting 10 videos.. Come out of the camera app &amp; leave the phone to cool down.. Don't bother shooting a video to test anymore.. Give it 1 days time &amp; meanwhile use your phone normally for any other function.. Test the video the next day &amp; check whether the issue persists.. If it still does, you can return the product.. Otherwise all well &amp; good.. I lost both 5 mins videos I shot this evening.. I will update a 5 mins video in a day or 2 for you to see the video quality yourself n whether there's any foggy tone in the video..<br/><br/>Aug 20th:-<br/><br/>Bought Xiaomi 12 Pro for 50K on Aug 7th in sale after card &amp; coupon discounts.. Below is my experience so far in these 12 days;-<br/><br/>Like to start with the display which is the best part about the phone.. This is one of the best ever screens on any smartphone ever!!.. A curved display that is 6.73\" E5 Amoled that is 120hz, LTPO 2, 10 Bit, QHD+, Dolby Vision, with 1050 nits max brightness (gsmarena tested) screen.. That has wonderful viewing angles, absolutely stunning hardware with no screen leak or dirty screen effects like it's competitors' inconsistent/ poor QCd units!.. Absolute ❤.. A few cons that I noticed though is the phone has more accidental touch issue due to curved screen than say my previous phones iQOO 9Pro &amp; Samsung Note20Ultra.. Also the phone doesn't come with a pre applied screen protector.. Had to get a good quality screen protector for 1000 rupees..<br/><br/>Nextly the speakers &amp; audio quality.. It's got Harmon Kardon tuned quad speakers (2 woofers + 2 tweeters), with 2 dedicated outlets, that is excellent.. Yes, it's not the loudest esp when compared to iphones &amp; Samsung flagships &amp; Oneplus flagships.. But the quad speakers show their speciality with a full range of sound &amp; with it's richness during any kind of audio output.. Compared the audio with my wife's iPhone 12 (as good as any iphone 13 series) &amp; that's where I make these observations.. Also I've owned Samsung flagships in the past to add on to the experience..<br/><br/>Design &amp; Build wise.. the phone is of the highest order possible with excellent design &amp; color options along with a solid/ very stylish metal frame that syncs with Gorilla Glass Victus display on the front &amp; Gorilla Glass 5 glass on the hind.. The bezels in the top &amp; bottom isn't the snallest of all though n the curve at the edges could be more boxy for my liking than the current design that's more roundish.. All in all the phone syncs overall with the Purple hue beautifully to make it a piece of art!.. The only sore miss is an IP68 rating sadly..<br/><br/>MiUi 13 on the phone is running July 2022 security update &amp; the UI is polished &amp; has excellent animations n look n feel!.. I have used phones with One UI, Color OS, Realme UI, Funtouch OS, iOS, Stock Androids (never used Oxygen OS though).. My most favorite UI for style n look n animations &amp; feel has to be MiUI amongst all!.. The sheer array of Wallpapers (incl free Live Wallpapers), Themes, Fonts that's available for free is unbelievably good n incomparable!!.. The way the haptics have been integrated into the UI is best of all to add on.. The haptic motor is amongst the best too!.. All is not roses for MiUI though with slightly lower stability in terms of smoothness &amp; consistency when compared to Color OS &amp; One UI which are butter smooth.. The battery &amp; general optimization is very well done though.. There were about 5-6 unwanted apps out of the box but most were straight uninstall while a few others I could remove using the adb function.. Overall very happy with the software experience so far.. Also adding on is a promise of 3 Major Android  updates until Android 15 &amp; security patches for 4 years!.. What is to be noted is Xiaomi doesn't provide prompt monthly updates.. It is only periodic like say once in 2 to 4 months which is not great..<br/><br/>Call quality over ear piece &amp; mic &amp; speaker is excellent.. The signal reception for sim card of various vendors - Vodafone/ Airtel/ Jio is all fine with very rare issues (I blame it to poor service than phone).. Wifi performance is fabulous with the best mobile modem attached to Snapdragon 8Gen1.. Bluetooth connectivity, NFC n all other modes of connectivity are top notch.. So very happy with these most primary functions on any phone..<br/><br/>Cameras wise the highlight is the primary rear custom made 50MP sensor Sony IMX707 which is fantastic in literally every condition for photography!.. It has 1 big issue that has to be addressed though.. The rear primary camera fogging while shooting video for anything more than 1.5 mins.. But this rear camera fogging isn't consistent &amp; sometimes it doesnt do it n fine too inbetween!.. But it's inconsistent for it's unpredictable performance.. The Ultrawide &amp; Telephoto/ Portrait cameras consist of 2 50MP Samsung JN1 sensors respectively.. This is an excellent setup &amp; they work very well for most functions.. The Telephoto/ Portrait cam has only 2X Optical zoom but that's a good enough feature with sharp &amp; pleasing zoom pics.. The Telephoto cam lacks OIS which is a miss according to me &amp; wouldve helped in low light zoom.. Similarly the Ultrawide cam lacks Autofocus &amp; that doesn't make it a Macro cam which is sad..

       "<span>The ratings i gave are considering other flagship phones in nearby price range from competitorsj(OnePlus/Samsung/Oppo/Vivo/Realme/Motorola/Apple/Pixel/Asus)!<br/><br/>Battery drain is very significant even when idle, didn't expect it in a flagship. (Looses 8-15% at night, when always on display is off, vibration is off, mobile data/WiFi is off)<br/>[Update September 2022: With latest software updates, battery drain when idle seems to have resolved to some extent. Also, there is no performance sacrifices for this. So, now I wouldn't consider battery drain a huge negative point, as the charging is really fast]<br/><br/>Also, even for for just casual usages there is slight heating issue, when outside temperature is 30-33°C (an average temperature in India; For those in cold places, there are issues too... keep reading!)<br/><br/>On gaming, it throttles a lot along with overheating at times, maybe given performance equivalent to Snapdragon 855 or 845, when heated up! Maybe going with Mi 11 Ultra would be a better choice, or go for 8Gen1 devices from other companies or wait for 8Gen1+! I really regret the decision to buy this phone, been using it for 1 week now!!!<br/><br/>I have been using Xiaomi products for many years, and decided to believe and buy a flagship from this company. But so far the experience is disappointing, and gives a midrange feel in many areas...<br/><br/> Over heating when used outside, for just regular usages, like Gmail, browsing the internet, Amazon etc...<br/><br/> Also, though the charging is fast, the battery drain is fast too...<br/><br/>And the camera needs a lot of optimization. Daylight photos, many times it's over exposed and over saturated and cases can be reddish. And HDR doesn't always work well. Its sometimes a disappointing performance, considering its supposed to be a flagship camera! Even that can be fixed by a software update...<br/>And maybe a good Gcam port is all I can hope for, if someone makes it, as i don't have much hope from Xiaomi...<br/><br/> But surely there are hardware issues too...<br/>Overheating is surely somewhat an hardware issue, given the negative feedback of 8Gen1...<br/>But the implementation in Mi 12 pro, seems so poor, and it makes things worse. It's advertising industry leading cooling systems, but performance isn't reflecting it!<br/><br/>Also, i recently went to a hill station(temperature was 13-20°C) and on trying the camera there, the phone heats up even there on using camera for few minutes, and fog got formed in the internal camera lens of the main camera unit, which is quite disappointing!  (Note: it's not outside the camera, that it can be wiped, but inside the camera.<br/>And saw in online forums and YouTube that it's a general issue with this model, especially the Chinese and Indian ones! Search and you can find the issue)<br/><br/>Hope the device doesn't get under-clocked, because I and most people who opt for a flagship care about high end performance.<br/><br/>So Xiaomi, if you are reading this, we all hope, an alternative fix for overheating can be implemented with software that doesn't involve sacrificing the performance of 8Gen1!<br/><br/> I will wait and see how Xiaomi takes feedback and fixes these issues(I have filled feedback using the feature provided within the phone)...<br/><br/>I am not even sure if customer feedback is even considered and I am doubting the trust and decision of buying a premium phone from Xiaomi...<br/><br/>On a positive note, the screen is excellent, main camera module is great in low light (though there are hiccups at times), also zoom camera isn't great, given its a 2x telephoto!<br/>The IR blaster, is a nice to have. Also it checks most of the features that is expected in a flagship. But it doesn't have an official IP rating, though they say its built to be IP 53 compliant. But flagships should be having IP 68.<br/><br/>Performance is smooth, which is expected, but there are software glitches at times, and the issue of overheating and battery drain! As the battery keeps draining fast, and if we keep charging with 120W, battery life is a question... Don't think it will last much long!<br/><br/>The charger is insane, but heavy and not very travel friendly....  And claimed charging speed of 18 mins isn't achievable unless phone doesn't heat up, which isn't possible unless you give it active cooling while charging!<br/>Realistically you get from 0-100% in 25-30 mins!</span>\n",

       "<span>1. Look &amp; Feel: 10/10. Good look device with amazing built quality. No doubt a flagship experience.<br/>2. Display: 10/10. Amazing display with 144 hz refresh rate and really bright. Easily beats iphone 14 and hold its own ground against even S22 ultra! This is as good as it gets. Although if I have to nit-pick, the auto brightness does screw up sometimes and you will have to manually adjust the brightness for best viewing experience. Also make sure you go into setting and select 2k &amp; 144 hz resolution. The system default out of the box is FHD+ only. I am pretty sure it’s made to save battery. onscreen fingerprint reader is reliable &amp; works well.<br/>3. Camera: 8/10. Camera is great for most part. I have observed it works best in 4:3 aspect ratio. I like my photos to fill the screen. In 16:9 or higher aspect ratio, many a times there is fish eye effect as well some blur on the edges. If you want to compare it to the true flagships, it definitely cannot compete. But it is still one of the best cameras out there.<br/>4. Battery Life: 6/10. Battery life is average at best. 5 hours screen on time with about 13 hours runtime is the best you can expect.<br/>5. SOC: 5/10. This phone has heating issues if you are a gamer or heavy user. Normal usage, heating is not an issue. Snapdragon 8 gen 1 definitely is a big hit &amp; miss. Do not buy this phone if you are looking for heavy usage and gaming.<br/>6. Software: 6/10. For most part the software is great. But with long term usage you will start noticing:<br/>a. Bloatware! Too many unnecessary apps, some you cannot even uninstall. The ‘Get app’ app store which is a system app and cannot be uninstalled keeps pushing you to install more bloatware!!<br/>b. Most widgets cannot be resized. Resizing widget is almost common sense now a days in android phones, cannot believe they have botched this up in this phone!<br/>c. Some high-end features like converting youtube videos into 2k in real time doesn’t work and many such features are just gimmicks at best.<br/>7. Keyboard: 5/10. There is some good haptic feedback while typing, but that is where the goodness ends. The autocorrect is downright horrible and I found typing is not that fast!<br/>8. Network: 5/10. If you are city dweller, you wouldn’t find this aspect as lacking. But if you are in hard-to-reach network places, I found this device quite lacking. In many places in my home where I used to get full network in my old phone, I get only 2 bars in this. And at the slightest hint of low network, it completely goes out of network.</span>\n",

       "<span>Guys you would not need to read any other review after this one. I will sum it up very clearly.<br/>This phone is a BEAST! I have only rated it 3 stars because of xaiomi not taking care of their best phone in the market, even i had to return it as well due to reasons I will mention below. I ordered this phone via an exchange of an old phone with broken screen in the sale which made this phone cost me around 35k which was a decent price since I always buy phones from 20k to 35k. The moment I received the mobile i was gone crazy. The way it looked was awesome, the way it felt in the hand was great, very premium! Massive 120 watt charging in just 20 mins was so lovely. I have used Lenovo,Vivo,poco, samsung,one plus but this one is the most wonderful looking phone I have ever held. Screen so responsive that even iPhone seems it's child. Camera so fantastic that i fell in love with the first video i recorded with it. potrait shot is whole new level. Great stabilization in the camera and speakers in the phone is just a cherry on top of the cake. Apart from this AI features to add a crisp on your video experience. Back camera is the just amazing but the front is just ok in comparison with the back one but does good enough. Now why did i only give it 3 stars and returned it. Well reason was that it had a minor issue of heating too much and battery draining quickly which was a little wears because I wasn't using the device heavily. I am very use to using mobiles and I know how fastly does a phone battery drain based on the usage but the the unit I got was draining unnecessarily but apart from battery everything else was a charm mind it guys so I ordered a replacement later, the next unit i received was a nightmare because this time I was having issues with the camera but not with the battery. The battery this time was draining according to my usage. Since it has tones of features supporting the next level amoled display so battery consumption was similar to that and I was pretty much ok with this device because it has a massive 120 wt charging which in 20 mins charged the phone from 20 to 100. So who cares if you get to charge your phone twice a day.<br/>But this unit has serious issues with the back camera. Fogs accumulated everytime I used the phone to make videos. This was irritating so I had to return it again. Remember friends the first unit i received had a battery issue and the second i received had a camera issue which means xaiomi is not taking care of the phone manufacturing up to the mark. The phone is excellent only if anyone gets the right unit.<br/>Now who should buy it?<br/>The one who has a good amount of savings with himself who can just buy a phone with a flaw or two, doesn't care if the unit had a battery issue or like that. I would have kept the phone avoiding the battery issue in the first unit since it can be charged in 15 minutes if i had good savings which I don't 😂 so I had to return it.<br/>If someone wants to know more about this phone he can mail me his queries at shashankkshekharr1990@gmail.com. i will happily clear any doubts.</span>\n",

       "<span>[---- changed my review to 1 star because after using this device for 2 months , its heating too much even in normal usage and very low display settings.<br/><br/>i set it to fhd only and refresh rate 60hz only. still temperature reaches 40 degree in normal usage . my previous device had sd865, and compare to that this feels a downgrade solely because of the overheating issue.<br/><br/> all other things are great no doubt but what good they do if i am not able to hold the mobile on my palm for more than 5 minutes. tried many solutions like resetting , debloating . none helpful so far. xiaomi should release a software fix for this issue. but they are busy launching new devices to sell but no long term support even in flagship devices . disappointing  ----]<br/><br/>i mainly bought the device because of the value for money and most importantly the display . the display is top notch. here are some things that i noticed.<br/><br/>#1.  the wqhd 2k display is totally worth it , colors are sharp , clarity is excellent , dolby visions further optmizes the video and images. dolby vision gives you feeling of watching movies on big tv screen . you have to enable it for every app , filter style hdr . but cant find any good tempered glass in the market for this device. that fits ut correctly<br/>#2.  camera produces very good colors  . i have used other flagships and its much better than anything i have seen so far first hand. rest you can see in attached images. although camera isn't my priority but i know when i see a good camera.<br/><br/>#3.  heating is what i was worried about but it even heats less than my older device with sd865 .  here it is hot climate these days . but for normal usage its battery remained within 38-42 degree celcius . cpu too ranges between 38 to 45 depending on your usage . ambient temperature is important factor here . i did not do gaming as of now , but will update later in this review after playing BGMI . also the device cools faster than any other device that i have used . [ edit : i played BGMI and very smooth experience . you do neeed to tweak some graphic settings though. 90hz rfresh rate is sufficient for this game , did not feel it heating more than the ordinary, do not play games while charging this device i suggest ]<br/><br/>#4. speed and productivity is super smooth . sd 8 gen 1 is worth it . all apps open so smoothly . i found big difference in compare to my previous device mi 10t pro  which has sd865 .  if i had to guess it is almost 100% jump in terms of speed and performance.<br/><br/>#6. dolby atmos is good , increases sound quality<br/><br/>#7. battery backup is i guess normal . i don't feel much difference Between sd865 and sd 8 gen 1 battery consumption. if you want your battery SOT longer . do not use charging boost feature. battery -backup will increase then.<br/><br/>#8. miui 13 is good optmized in this device in  compare to miui 12.5 that i used to have in my older device  .<br/><br/>#9. indisplay fingerprint scanner is not that fast i think it needs further software optimisations. it gives warning of \"only use compatible screen protector\" , but do not provide any information where i can  find that  . i am yet to receive tempered glass that i ordered , i will update once i apply that and see if fingerprint sensor still works after applying or not  .<br/><br/>#10. there is no pre- applied screen protector<br/><br/>#11. silicon back case cover that comes with it... is really really good.  perfectly designed.<br/><br/>#12. design is good . doesnt feel bulky . weight distribution is really nicely done.<br/><br/>#13.  opera Mauve color seems good that i bought, but i did expect better<br/><br/>#14. the back part i dont know if it is gorilla glass or something else . but it feels different. may be its scratch resistant or not i have no idea . but its definitely dust resistant.<br/><br/>overall excellent flagship . i got 12 gb 256gb version for only 57k after discount. worth it.<br/>i bought this device after comparing it with other sd 8 gen 1 , found this one good on paper so chose it . now i can say it is as good as in reality too .<br/><br/>i will update the review if i face any issues ,<br/><br/>Note- for temperature monitor use 'cpu monitor' app it shows overall cpu temperature and not just of one core.</span>\n",

Battery - 4600mhz ist 10days its decreasimg like a hell,mobile heats and battery deain even in normal usage like watch yt , WhatsApp , telegram<br/>But finnally i get solution no more issue now<br/>Before 14%/h on normal usage ,but now 9%/h means 10h+ screen on time.<br/>I also share screenshot of my battery usage after do some important settings<br/>9 out of 10<br/>4. Charging - 120w charging is good,but you forget your mobile for 15-20minute ,because if we use mobile with charging then its charging speed decrease to 18w , don't know why may be fix in ist updates ,but if we don't use then its charge very fast take upto 20-30minute for full charge<br/>9 out of 10<br/>5. Camera - 50,50,50mp but i don't want to say nothing about it because iam not much use camera and not have proper knowledge of pictures quality but its better then all mobile under 60k<br/>Front camera need liitle improvement<br/>9 out of 10<br/><br/>6.

       "<span>Been using this phone for 7 days now. My review during this breif period are as below:<br/>1. Display: The best out there. Nothing can get better than QHD+, 2K, 120Hz LTPO, Dolby vision, HDR10+ display. Its vibrant however the QHD+ drains more battery. FHD+ resolution isn't bad either. So I have set for FHD+ and during OTT consumption I change to QHD+.<br/>2. Speakers: Tuned by Harman Kardon, it's not the loudest but the quality of the output is great. You can feel the difference when paired with any earphones.<br/>3. Processor: The hottest processor by Qualcomm 😁😁. Made by Samsung, this processor has turned the fortunes of Qualcomm. Since the performance is not tuned down, so the processor tends to get warm with normal usage and hot with heavy usage. Xiaomi need to push OTA to limit the processor otherwise we can cook omlette on this during summers.<br/>4. Cameras: Triple 50MP set up delivers exceptionally well photos. Many people are getting fog issue in the camera. I haven't got this. I have tried recording 4k @30 and 60fps and 8k @24fps both in indoors as well as outdoors. No such issue found. Selfie is least used in my phone so can't really comment on that.<br/>5. Software: I have been using MiUI since 2018 and I really adapt to the UI of any phone. As Xiaomi has promised 3 yrs of Android update and 4 yrs of security updates so the phone will go till Android 15. That's a good sign.<br/>6. Charger: The 120W charger is heavy. But I have not used boost charger. I use normal charging which is quite fast. Also I use 22.5W mi charger for better battery life.<br/>7. Battery life: First it was giving around 5hrs of SOT. Then it increased to 7hrs. Actually the phone is adapting itself. So the SOT will increase after few usage. Also I'm using this as my secondary phone as of now.<br/>8. Finger print is slow. And I think the area for fingerprint is also bit smaller.<br/><br/>Bought this after exchanging my favourite Redmi K20 pro @37000. At that price I felt I should give it a try. Earlier thought of Samsung S22+ but my budget was upto 50k. So I could not stretch myself upto that. Will update more when I use the phone extensively.</span>\n",

       "<span>My impression after about three months of use. A nice mobile phone, but not at this price even after recent price cut with 13 pro launch. The only advantages I see for this mobile device are its camera, sound, and customizable user interface. Batteries backup is a major disadvantage. Yeah, it charges in 18 minutes and discharges incredibly quickly, lasting less than 7 hours of continuous use. The back panel is extremely slippery and must be handled with extreme caution when used with one hand. 3.5 jack is not provided. Instead need to use c port convertor.</span>\n",

       "<span>Overall it's a good quality phone. The outer layer of the box came in wet wich some oil/moisture all over the box. But i guess it didn't affect the phone.  I have been using it for over a week. The battery could have lasted a little longer but the fast charging makes up for it. Some apps especially the unpopular ones tend to crash here and there with MIUI which users must note. My biggest issue is when i record videos at 1080p at 30 or 60 fps, and i send it over WhatsApp...the video gets compressed so much that it's laggy and unwatchable. Overall ..I'm happy with the product</span>\n",

      " Mar 6th:-The phone is performing very well after the last update. I started using the phone in the full performance mode under battery settings to see the experience.. I would say this is the best way to get the complete experience of the full potential of the Snapdragon 8Gen1.. I know the ultimate battery life will be less than the balance mode however the difference is not big!.. Also with its full potential the phone is just absolutely stutter free n just flows no matter what you do!.. So suggest the readers to try it out to see how it feels for yourself..The big update is I have ordered the new Xiaomi 13 Pro in mi.com and I am happy/ sad to say this is my last post here as I am exchanging my Xiaomi 12 Pro for the new phone.. I'm so excited to experience the new monster while I'm sad to let go off this beauty the Xiaomi 12 Pro ❤.. Easily the best phone I have owned ever in my life so far!.. Just love the Xiaomi flagships and I hope the experience remains so in the future..I wish all the best to new Xiaomi 12 Pro buyers and my ownership review should help you give confidence to own this beauty at now revised 2023 price of just 50K!.. Over & Out 👍Feb 14th:-The phone's UI feels so much smoother now!.. The memory management has improved vastly & battery life has improved significantly too!!.. Thanks to MiUi 14 (Android 13) improvements.. There are minor bugs nevertheless with Screen recording option disappearing all of sudden from yesterday!.. Certain settings under developer options changing by itself etc.. But these are very minor issues to worry about..Feb 11th:-Got Android 13 based MiUi14 on my phone finally!!.. Comes with Jan 2023 Android security patch.. The phone instantly feels butter smooth!!.. wooh!.. Attached screenshot of the Android version..Jan 6th:-Yet to get any security patch after Sep 2022!.. It has been 4 months since now.. I'm disappointed frankly in terms of updates.. I understand that the phone is due & should be amongst 1st to get Android 13 based MiUI 14 to arrive anytime now.. But that is not an excuse to not provide this long!.. I expected a Dec 2022 update atleast by now..In terms of battery there has been a decline in backup esp when on mobile data.. Thanks to 5G network now.. For whatever reason the auto brightness of the phone is continuously very high than what is required (adding to average battery performance).. There has been a few stutters in the UI I'm noticing which could be again related to lack of updates!.. Also I notice very aggressive RAM management performance where certain apps get killed immediately as soon as I get out of it!.. Possibly it's got to do with MiUI's irritating battery saving attempt..Anyways hoping for some improvements in my next update.. Fingers crossed..Nov 27th:-Got my vodafone primary sim ported to Airtel & have Jio as my secondary sim.. Both are giving me 5g internet with Jio giving consistently more 5g connectivity than Airtel. The Phone is blazing fast now in terms of browsing & YouTube etc.. Attaching some screen for 5g performance of the phone!..Oct 19th:-Got an update to enable 5g services for the phone. Under settings though I don't see any changes.Had been to Kashmir vacation where the phone was used fully.. The battery loss was quiet significant outdoors on mobile data with 2 sim cards.. The main reason for it is it's display that's almost at full brightness in auto mode.. Also due to poor signals in Kashmir, the phone is continously working to look for a stable mobile network.. The photos came out fantastic for it's segment & I was comparing it against iPhone 13 Mini/ iPhone 12 Pro/ iPhone 12/ S20 FE 5G of my cousins.. A lot of times my cousins preferred me to take the main cam shots from Xiaomi 12 Pro over others!.. The selfie performance was average at best though.. The telephoto/ zoom performance was toe to toe with iPhone 12 Pro in both photos & videos!!.. Coming to the most controversial video shooting performance, most of the videos ranging from 30 secs to nearly 10 mins in the most unique HDR10+ quality came out fabulous!!.. The video quality was not comparable to iPhone 12 Pro/ 13 as soon as the natural lights came down though.. The iPhones showed their superiority clearly in low light/ sunset videos..Will keep updating my experience further as days go..Oct 9th:-Have got September security patch. The routine is one security patch every 2-3 months typical of Xiaomi.. The update had nothing else other than security patch in it..The phone is otherwise performing same n is top notch & Im extremely happy with the device..Sep 17th:-Performance of the phone has improved now!.. Xiaomi has done some magic.. Even the phones highest cpu temperature against any load is only 60 degrees as against 75 degrees before!Attaching new benchmark app results..Aug 29th:-Attaching some screenshots from my phone for all the battery life cribbers & potential customers & interested fellows..I got a Screen On Time (SOT) of over 7:30 hours today!!!.. See for yourself before judging the battery life of Xiaomi 12 Pro.. I have also attached a set of screenshots from my phone settings that affect battery life..Always give time to your phone & the advanced AI in it to start reading what kind of user it is working with!.. My phone is 20+ days old now & it has learnt how I use my phone & how to optimise it.. So dont jump to conclusions by looking at your phone in hours!!..My phone today was used indoors mainly with mostly on Wifi but has 2 SIMs in it.. Bluetooth on for occasional smartphone connectivity & other settings in the screenshot.. Also reiterating that the phone has very good standby battery time too even with Always On Display..Aug 25th:-Attaching 4K@60fps video of 2 mins length.. I tried attaching 5 mins video I shot but Amazon says the file is too big to be attached!.. So I can't upload the 5 mins video.. What I can confirm though is no camera fogging visible anymore in the rear sensor.. Nor is the video shootage (both videos) had any fogging visible at all!!.. Remember we are talking about a phone that had it originally..After 5+2 mins of 4K@60fps, the phone was warm.. The battery temperature showed 45 degrees max.. Just FYI..Aug 24th:-I see a lot of customers are unhappy with the phone after purchasing as there is fog in the rear camera. They rate the phone 1 star & want to return it.. It's their wish as it's their product/ money..But I had a suggestion to kind off resolve this issue as I have done for my phone.. I made 2 videos today to test the situation.. 5 mins 4K@60fps videos each from the main rear sensor.. I had no fogging issues to note!!.. Just to remind the readers, my phone also had camera fogging issue while shooting videos from the main cam in the past (have made a note of it in my review below for reference)..So what did I do to resolve the issue.. Just shoot 5 mins length 4K@60fps videos from the main camera.. Shoot 10 videos back to back of 5 mins length in the same resolution.. The phone will heat up badly.. Let it heat up.. Once done shooting 10 videos.. Come out of the camera app & leave the phone to cool down.. Don't bother shooting a video to test anymore.. Give it 1 days time & meanwhile use your phone normally for any other function.. Test the video the next day & check whether the issue persists.. If it still does, you can return the product.. Otherwise all well & good.. I lost both 5 mins videos I shot this evening.. I will update a 5 mins video in a day or 2 for you to see the video quality yourself n whether there's any foggy tone in the video..Aug 20th:-Bought Xiaomi 12 Pro for 50K on Aug 7th in sale after card & coupon discounts.. Below is my experience so far in these 12 days;-Like to start with the display which is the best part about the phone.. This is one of the best ever screens on any smartphone ever!!.. A curved display that is 6.73\" E5 Amoled that is 120hz, LTPO 2, 10 Bit, QHD+, Dolby Vision, with 1050 nits max brightness (gsmarena tested) screen.. That has wonderful viewing angles, absolutely stunning hardware with no screen leak or dirty screen effects like it's competitors' inconsistent/ poor QCd units!.. Absolute ❤.. A few cons that I noticed though is the phone has more accidental touch issue due to curved screen than say my previous phones iQOO 9Pro & Samsung Note20Ultra.. Also the phone doesn't come with a pre applied screen protector.. Had to get a good quality screen protector for 1000 rupees..Nextly the speakers & audio quality.. It's got Harmon Kardon tuned quad speakers (2 woofers + 2 tweeters), with 2 dedicated outlets, that is excellent.. Yes, it's not the loudest esp when compared to iphones & Samsung flagships & Oneplus flagships.. But the quad speakers show their speciality with a full range of sound & with it's richness during any kind of audio output.. Compared the audio with my wife's iPhone 12 (as good as any iphone 13 series) & that's where I make these observations.. Also I've owned Samsung flagships in the past to add on to the experience..Design & Build wise.. the phone is of the highest order possible with excellent design & color options along with a solid/ very stylish metal frame that syncs with Gorilla Glass Victus display on the front & Gorilla Glass 5 glass on the hind.. The bezels in the top & bottom isn't the snallest of all though n the curve at the edges could be more boxy for my liking than the current design that's more roundish.. All in all the phone syncs overall with the Purple hue beautifully to make it a piece of art!.. The only sore miss is an IP68 rating sadly..MiUi 13 on the phone is running July 2022 security update & the UI is polished & has excellent animations n look n feel!.. I have used phones with One UI, Color OS, Realme UI, Funtouch OS, iOS, Stock Androids (never used Oxygen OS though).. My most favorite UI for style n look n animations & feel has to be MiUI amongst all!.. The sheer array of Wallpapers (incl free Live Wallpapers), Themes, Fonts that's available for free is unbelievably good n incomparable!!.. The way the haptics have been integrated into the UI is best of all to add on.. The haptic motor is amongst the best too!.. All is not roses for MiUI though with slightly lower stability in terms of smoothness & consistency when compared to Color OS & One UI which are butter smooth.. The battery & general optimization is very well done though.. There were about 5-6 unwanted apps out of the box but most were straight uninstall while a few others I could remove using the adb function.. Overall very happy with the software experience so far.. Also adding on is a promise of 3 Major Android  updates until Android 15 & security patches for 4 years!.. What is to be noted is Xiaomi doesn't provide prompt monthly updates.. It is only periodic like say once in 2 to 4 months which is not great..Call quality over ear piece & mic & speaker is excellent.. The signal reception for sim card of various vendors - Vodafone/ Airtel/ Jio is all fine with very rare issues (I blame it to poor service than phone).. Wifi performance is fabulous with the best mobile modem attached to Snapdragon 8Gen1.. Bluetooth connectivity, NFC n all other modes of connectivity are top notch.. So very happy with these most primary functions on any phone..Cameras wise the highlight is the primary rear custom made 50MP sensor Sony IMX707 which is fantastic in literally every condition for photography!.. It has 1 big issue that has to be addressed though.. The rear primary camera fogging while shooting video for anything more than 1.5 mins.. But this rear camera fogging isn't consistent & sometimes it doesnt do it n fine too inbetween!.. But it's inconsistent for it's unpredictable performance.. The Ultrawide & Telephoto/ Portrait cameras consist of 2 50MP Samsung JN1 sensors respectively.. This is an excellent setup & they work very well for most functions.. The Telephoto/ Portrait cam has only 2X Optical zoom but that's a good enough feature with sharp & pleasing zoom pics.. The Telephoto cam lacks OIS which is a miss according to me & wouldve helped in low light zoom.. Similarly the Ultrawide cam lacks Autofocus & that doesn't make it a Macro cam which is sad.. All 3 rear cams can shoot good quality 4K@60fps videos with excellent stability!.. The night time photo/ video shooting is also top notch thanks to excellent implementation of bright flash with good flash timing & length to assist.. Overall very capable rear cameras.. Selfie cam wise it's a 32MP Omnivision sensor which isn't great hardware wise.. I would've wished a top Sony sensor instead.. The dynamic range of the selfie is very limited.. The phone takes a full 32MP snap & isn't pixel binned yet the sharpness isn't great n the photos come out slightly soft.. Yet Xiaomi's excellent post processing capabilities make the selfie cam Above Average overall for stills.. Night mode in selfie helps brighten the screen for additional light while autofocus assistance by the AI system for selfie helps a great deal overall.. Selfie video shooting is capped at 1080p@60fps resolution at max but has very good stability due to EIS.. Overall a very good camera experience considering I'm not too much of a video shooter..Battery backup has been good.. Yes I'm saying good unlike many in this forum.. The users should understand that the phone has an SOC thats amongst the fastest & more powerful on the planet n a sportscar can never give you a commuter car's fuel efficiency!.. Well apart from this logic have attached a couple of screenshots where I have easily recorded over 6hrs of Screen On Time!.. This is with always only at 120hz + QHD+ + Other visual enhancement settings + Always on display all the time + Live Wallpaper + high haptics but with only dark mode & Auto brightness enabled (Auto brightness is generally on high brightness most of the times).. The phone has excellent idle time battery optimization thanks to MiUI.. The 120 watts charger tops up the phone in quick time but has a USB Type A to Type C connectors.. It isn't say as fast charging as iQOO 9 Pro's more mordern Type C to Type C port that charges more faster.. Finally the heating aspect of the phone.. Please note that amongst the Snapdragon 8Gen1 phones like - Samsung S22 series, OnePlus 10Pro, iQOO 9Pro, Realme GT2 etc.. Only Xiaomi 12 Pro has unrestricted 8Gen1 speed (ie not downclocking the chipset in the fear of overheating).. The phone consistently scores above 9 lacs in Antutu with CPU score of over 2 lacs no matter any condition unlike all of it's competitors!.. The others have downclocked their chipsets to control overheating.. What this means is Yes the chipset is notorious for overheating when stressed.. I have seen a max of 75 degrees celcius of CPU & 50 degrees of battery Temperature when pushed to it's extreme in Antutu test.. Also when I shot multiple 4K videos of 5 mins length for more than 30 mins at a stretch, got a message saying the phone has overheated & give it a break.. So yes the phone has overheating issue but again only when pushed to heavy duty.. Otherwise for regular operation it is fine.. Runs at a CPU temperature ranging from 40 to 50 degrees & battery from 32 to 42 degrees which is normal..The fingerprint sensor is a regular optical unit.. It is nowhere near as fascinating/ secure/ fast as iQOO 9 Pro's 3D Ultrasonic unit that's just the best ever!..On the whole at 50K there cannot be a better smartphone than this ever!.. Really happy with the phone also considering it's cons..I whole heartedly recommend this phone to all until you are a frequent video shooter & a gamer (overheating issue)..\n",
      "Positive review: The ratings i gave are considering other flagship phones in nearby price range from competitorsj(OnePlus/Samsung/Oppo/Vivo/Realme/Motorola/Apple/Pixel/Asus)!Battery drain is very significant even when idle, didn't expect it in a flagship. (Looses 8-15% at night, when always on display is off, vibration is off, mobile data/WiFi is off)[Update September 2022: With latest software updates, battery drain when idle seems to have resolved to some extent. Also, there is no performance sacrifices for this. So, now I wouldn't consider battery drain a huge negative point, as the charging is really fast]Also, even for for just casual usages there is slight heating issue, when outside temperature is 30-33°C (an average temperature in India; For those in cold places, there are issues too... keep reading!)On gaming, it throttles a lot along with overheating at times, maybe given performance equivalent to Snapdragon 855 or 845, when heated up! Maybe going with Mi 11 Ultra would be a better choice, or go for 8Gen1 devices from other companies or wait for 8Gen1+! I really regret the decision to buy this phone, been using it for 1 week now!!!I have been using Xiaomi products for many years, and decided to believe and buy a flagship from this company. But so far the experience is disappointing, and gives a midrange feel in many areas... Over heating when used outside, for just regular usages, like Gmail, browsing the internet, Amazon etc... Also, though the charging is fast, the battery drain is fast too...And the camera needs a lot of optimization. Daylight photos, many times it's over exposed and over saturated and cases can be reddish. And HDR doesn't always work well. Its sometimes a disappointing performance, considering its supposed to be a flagship camera! Even that can be fixed by a software update...And maybe a good Gcam port is all I can hope for, if someone makes it, as i don't have much hope from Xiaomi... But surely there are hardware issues too...Overheating is surely somewhat an hardware issue, given the negative feedback of 8Gen1...But the implementation in Mi 12 pro, seems so poor, and it makes things worse. It's advertising industry leading cooling systems, but performance isn't reflecting it!Also, i recently went to a hill station(temperature was 13-20°C) and on trying the camera there, the phone heats up even there on using camera for few minutes, and fog got formed in the internal camera lens of the main camera unit, which is quite disappointing!  (Note: it's not outside the camera, that it can be wiped, but inside the camera.And saw in online forums and YouTube that it's a general issue with this model, especially the Chinese and Indian ones! Search and you can find the issue)Hope the device doesn't get under-clocked, because I and most people who opt for a flagship care about high end performance.So Xiaomi, if you are reading this, we all hope, an alternative fix for overheating can be implemented with software that doesn't involve sacrificing the performance of 8Gen1! I will wait and see how Xiaomi takes feedback and fixes these issues(I have filled feedback using the feature provided within the phone)...I am not even sure if customer feedback is even considered and I am doubting the trust and decision of buying a premium phone from Xiaomi...On a positive note, the screen is excellent, main camera module is great in low light (though there are hiccups at times), also zoom camera isn't great, given its a 2x telephoto!The IR blaster, is a nice to have. Also it checks most of the features that is expected in a flagship. But it doesn't have an official IP rating, though they say its built to be IP 53 compliant. But flagships should be having IP 68.Performance is smooth, which is expected, but there are software glitches at times, and the issue of overheating and battery drain! As the battery keeps draining fast, and if we keep charging with 120W, battery life is a question... Don't think it will last much long!The charger is insane, but heavy and not very travel friendly....  And claimed charging speed of 18 mins isn't achievable unless phone doesn't heat up, which isn't possible unless you give it active cooling while charging!Realistically you get from 0-100% in 25-30 mins!\n"

      "Positive review: 1. Look & Feel: 10/10. Good look device with amazing built quality. No doubt a flagship experience.2. Display: 10/10. Amazing display with 144 hz refresh rate and really bright. Easily beats iphone 14 and hold its own ground against even S22 ultra! This is as good as it gets. Although if I have to nit-pick, the auto brightness does screw up sometimes and you will have to manually adjust the brightness for best viewing experience. Also make sure you go into setting and select 2k & 144 hz resolution. The system default out of the box is FHD+ only. I am pretty sure it’s made to save battery. onscreen fingerprint reader is reliable & works well.3. Camera: 8/10. Camera is great for most part. I have observed it works best in 4:3 aspect ratio. I like my photos to fill the screen. In 16:9 or higher aspect ratio, many a times there is fish eye effect as well some blur on the edges. If you want to compare it to the true flagships, it definitely cannot compete. But it is still one of the best cameras out there.4. Battery Life: 6/10. Battery life is average at best. 5 hours screen on time with about 13 hours runtime is the best you can expect.5. SOC: 5/10. This phone has heating issues if you are a gamer or heavy user. Normal usage, heating is not an issue. Snapdragon 8 gen 1 definitely is a big hit & miss. Do not buy this phone if you are looking for heavy usage and gaming.6. Software: 6/10. For most part the software is great. But with long term usage you will start noticing:a. Bloatware! Too many unnecessary apps, some you cannot even uninstall. The ‘Get app’ app store which is a system app and cannot be uninstalled keeps pushing you to install more bloatware!!b. Most widgets cannot be resized. Resizing widget is almost common sense now a days in android phones, cannot believe they have botched this up in this phone!c. Some high-end features like converting youtube videos into 2k in real time doesn’t work and many such features are just gimmicks at best.7. Keyboard: 5/10. There is some good haptic feedback while typing, but that is where the goodness ends. The autocorrect is downright horrible and I found typing is not that fast!8. Network: 5/10. If you are city dweller, you wouldn’t find this aspect as lacking. But if you are in hard-to-reach network places, I found this device quite lacking. In many places in my home where I used to get full network in my old phone, I get only 2 bars in this. And at the slightest hint of low network, it completely goes out of network.\n",
      "Positive review: Guys you would not need to read any other review after this one. I will sum it up very clearly.This phone is a BEAST! I have only rated it 3 stars because of xaiomi not taking care of their best phone in the market, even i had to return it as well due to reasons I will mention below. I ordered this phone via an exchange of an old phone with broken screen in the sale which made this phone cost me around 35k which was a decent price since I always buy phones from 20k to 35k. The moment I received the mobile i was gone crazy. The way it looked was awesome, the way it felt in the hand was great, very premium! Massive 120 watt charging in just 20 mins was so lovely. I have used Lenovo,Vivo,poco, samsung,one plus but this one is the most wonderful looking phone I have ever held. Screen so responsive that even iPhone seems it's child. Camera so fantastic that i fell in love with the first video i recorded with it. potrait shot is whole new level. Great stabilization in the camera and speakers in the phone is just a cherry on top of the cake. Apart from this AI features to add a crisp on your video experience. Back camera is the just amazing but the front is just ok in comparison with the back one but does good enough. Now why did i only give it 3 stars and returned it. Well reason was that it had a minor issue of heating too much and battery draining quickly which was a little wears because I wasn't using the device heavily. I am very use to using mobiles and I know how fastly does a phone battery drain based on the usage but the the unit I got was draining unnecessarily but apart from battery everything else was a charm mind it guys so I ordered a replacement later, the next unit i received was a nightmare because this time I was having issues with the camera but not with the battery. The battery this time was draining according to my usage. Since it has tones of features supporting the next level amoled display so battery consumption was similar to that and I was pretty much ok with this device because it has a massive 120 wt charging which in 20 mins charged the phone from 20 to 100. So who cares if you get to charge your phone twice a day.But this unit has serious issues with the back camera. Fogs accumulated everytime I used the phone to make videos. This was irritating so I had to return it again. Remember friends the first unit i received had a battery issue and the second i received had a camera issue which means xaiomi is not taking care of the phone manufacturing up to the mark. The phone is excellent only if anyone gets the right unit.Now who should buy it?The one who has a good amount of savings with himself who can just buy a phone with a flaw or two, doesn't care if the unit had a battery issue or like that. I would have kept the phone avoiding the battery issue in the first unit since it can be charged in 15 minutes if i had good savings which I don't 😂 so I had to return it.If someone wants to know more about this phone he can mail me his queries at shashankkshekharr1990@gmail.com. i will happily clear any doubts.\n",

      "Positive review: [---- changed my review to 1 star because after using this device for 2 months , its heating too much even in normal usage and very low display settings.i set it to fhd only and refresh rate 60hz only. still temperature reaches 40 degree in normal usage . my previous device had sd865, and compare to that this feels a downgrade solely because of the overheating issue. all other things are great no doubt but what good they do if i am not able to hold the mobile on my palm for more than 5 minutes. tried many solutions like resetting , debloating . none helpful so far. xiaomi should release a software fix for this issue. but they are busy launching new devices to sell but no long term support even in flagship devices . disappointing  ----]i mainly bought the device because of the value for money and most importantly the display . the display is top notch. here are some things that i noticed.#1.  the wqhd 2k display is totally worth it , colors are sharp , clarity is excellent , dolby visions further optmizes the video and images. dolby vision gives you feeling of watching movies on big tv screen . you have to enable it for every app , filter style hdr . but cant find any good tempered glass in the market for this device. that fits ut correctly#2.  camera produces very good colors  . i have used other flagships and its much better than anything i have seen so far first hand. rest you can see in attached images. although camera isn't my priority but i know when i see a good camera.#3.  heating is what i was worried about but it even heats less than my older device with sd865 .  here it is hot climate these days . but for normal usage its battery remained within 38-42 degree celcius . cpu too ranges between 38 to 45 depending on your usage . ambient temperature is important factor here . i did not do gaming as of now , but will update later in this review after playing BGMI . also the device cools faster than any other device that i have used . [ edit : i played BGMI and very smooth experience . you do neeed to tweak some graphic settings though. 90hz rfresh rate is sufficient for this game , did not feel it heating more than the ordinary, do not play games while charging this device i suggest ]#4. speed and productivity is super smooth . sd 8 gen 1 is worth it . all apps open so smoothly . i found big difference in compare to my previous device mi 10t pro  which has sd865 .  if i had to guess it is almost 100% jump in terms of speed and performance.#6. dolby atmos is good , increases sound quality#7. battery backup is i guess normal . i don't feel much difference Between sd865 and sd 8 gen 1 battery consumption. if you want your battery SOT longer . do not use charging boost feature. battery -backup will increase then.#8. miui 13 is good optmized in this device in  compare to miui 12.5 that i used to have in my older device  .#9. indisplay fingerprint scanner is not that fast i think it needs further software optimisations. it gives warning of \"only use compatible screen protector\" , but do not provide any information where i can  find that  . i am yet to receive tempered glass that i ordered , i will update once i apply that and see if fingerprint sensor still works after applying or not  .#10. there is no pre- applied screen protector#11. silicon back case cover that comes with it... is really really good.  perfectly designed.#12. design is good . doesnt feel bulky . weight distribution is really nicely done.#13.  opera Mauve color seems good that i bought, but i did expect better#14. the back part i dont know if it is gorilla glass or something else . but it feels different. may be its scratch resistant or not i have no idea . but its definitely dust resistant.overall excellent flagship . i got 12 gb 256gb version for only 57k after discount. worth it.i bought this device after comparing it with other sd 8 gen 1 , found this one good on paper so chose it . now i can say it is as good as in reality too .i will update the review if i face any issues ,Note- for temperature monitor use 'cpu monitor' app it shows overall cpu temperature and not just of one core.\n",
      "Positive review: Lets review of this mobile by using 30days1.  Display - fhd and qhd option available here and 60,90,120fps option available,pure smooth curved display,you always happy with display if you buy this mobile its his best highlights and really great display like samsung flagship mobile display10 out of 10 for display2. Processor - everyone know how powerful 8gen1 is but real problem on this cpu is heating. But i found his solution now my temperature on heavy usage never gone more then 40°c and on normal usage below 35°c. i get this solution after use 10days mobile , you can dm me at telegram @pk320 or join the official group of mi 12 pro at telegram for the heating solution now no more heating issue or battery drain issue9 out of 103. Battery - 4600mhz ist 10days its decreasimg like a hell,mobile heats and battery deain even in normal usage like watch yt , WhatsApp , telegramBut finnally i get solution no more issue nowBefore 14%/h on normal usage ,but now 9%/h means 10h+ screen on time.I also share screenshot of my battery usage after do some important settings9 out of 104. Charging - 120w charging is good,but you forget your mobile for 15-20minute ,because if we use mobile with charging then its charging speed decrease to 18w , don't know why may be fix in ist updates ,but if we don't use then its charge very fast take upto 20-30minute for full charge9 out of 105. Camera - 50,50,50mp but i don't want to say nothing about it because iam not much use camera and not have proper knowledge of pictures quality but its better then all mobile under 60kFront camera need liitle improvement9 out of 106. Look - yah! The thing you love this mobile is his look ,too beautiful mobile ,well its 6.73inch screen but didn't feel we using big screen and weight management is too good,camera design ,display design and back all thing make it so beautiful10 out of 107. Ui - miui-; personally not like it,but its way much better then 30k mi mobile miui it have less bug and more premium but i love custom rom in mi mobile so waiting for custom romWe can easily lock and unlock bootloader without any warranty issue8 out of 10Extra feature - dual speaker,good back cover,ram and storage is latest and fast,ir blaster, notification light,type c to 3.5mm in box ,good custom rom support,wifi 6 , Bluetooth 5.2 and solid victus glass in front and gorila glass in back (buy screen firm or guard important)Cons. - 1. No 3.5mm jack2. No screen protector pre applied No more issue i found on this mobileIf you want a premium mobile under 53k then this is great mobileNever buy iqoo 9 pro (ui is worst and no custom rom support)Everything is top no doubt great mobile at his price don't waste time to find a best mobile under 50k buy it today and i honestly say you never disappointed with this purchase. 100% recommendedSome people not buy because of heating issue or somebody review very bad means he say about software bug here in review but these problem can solved easily by software update and custom romHeating issue finnally solved you can join official group at telegram or can dm me also no more battery drain or heating issueIam very happy with my purchaseI also buy mi pad 5 with it also a great tab but wifi only ok buy i will keep updated my review if i found good or wrong thingsIts not paid review genuie review after using it for 30days ok thnx\n"

      "Positive review: Been using this phone for 7 days now. My review during this breif period are as below:1. Display: The best out there. Nothing can get better than QHD+, 2K, 120Hz LTPO, Dolby vision, HDR10+ display. Its vibrant however the QHD+ drains more battery. FHD+ resolution isn't bad either. So I have set for FHD+ and during OTT consumption I change to QHD+.2. Speakers: Tuned by Harman Kardon, it's not the loudest but the quality of the output is great. You can feel the difference when paired with any earphones.3. Processor: The hottest processor by Qualcomm 😁😁. Made by Samsung, this processor has turned the fortunes of Qualcomm. Since the performance is not tuned down, so the processor tends to get warm with normal usage and hot with heavy usage. Xiaomi need to push OTA to limit the processor otherwise we can cook omlette on this during summers.4. Cameras: Triple 50MP set up delivers exceptionally well photos. Many people are getting fog issue in the camera. I haven't got this. I have tried recording 4k @30 and 60fps and 8k @24fps both in indoors as well as outdoors. No such issue found. Selfie is least used in my phone so can't really comment on that.5. Software: I have been using MiUI since 2018 and I really adapt to the UI of any phone. As Xiaomi has promised 3 yrs of Android update and 4 yrs of security updates so the phone will go till Android 15. That's a good sign.6. Charger: The 120W charger is heavy. But I have not used boost charger. I use normal charging which is quite fast. Also I use 22.5W mi charger for better battery life.7. Battery life: First it was giving around 5hrs of SOT. Then it increased to 7hrs. Actually the phone is adapting itself. So the SOT will increase after few usage. Also I'm using this as my secondary phone as of now.8. Finger print is slow. And I think the area for fingerprint is also bit smaller.Bought this after exchanging my favourite Redmi K20 pro @37000. At that price I felt I should give it a try. Earlier thought of Samsung S22+ but my budget was upto 50k. So I could not stretch myself upto that. Will update more when I use the phone extensively.\n",
      "Positive review: My impression after about three months of use. A nice mobile phone, but not at this price even after recent price cut with 13 pro launch. The only advantages I see for this mobile device are its camera, sound, and customizable user interface. Batteries backup is a major disadvantage. Yeah, it charges in 18 minutes and discharges incredibly quickly, lasting less than 7 hours of continuous use. The back panel is extremely slippery and must be handled with extreme caution when used with one hand. 3.5 jack is not provided. Instead need to use c port convertor.\n",
      "Positive review: Overall it's a good quality phone. The outer layer of the box came in wet wich some oil/moisture all over the box. But i guess it didn't affect the phone.  I have been using it for over a week. The battery could have lasted a little longer but the fast charging makes up for it. Some apps especially the unpopular ones tend to crash here and there with MIUI which users must note. My biggest issue is when i record videos at 1080p at 30 or 60 fps, and i send it over WhatsApp...the video gets compressed so much that it's laggy and unwatchable. Overall ..I'm happy with the product\n"

      "bang-for-the-buck[+3][u]##it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there . \n",
      "size[+2],weight[+2],navigational system[+2], sound[+3]##like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) . \n",
      "screen[+3]##the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better . \n",
      "##further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 . \n",

      "signal to noise ratio[+2]##the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods . \n",

      "sound[+2],power output[+2]##1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's \" unspecified \" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers . \n",
      "volume[+2]##with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) . \n",
      "player[+2]##the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers . \n",
      "user interface[+2],navigation[+2]##2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection . \n",
      "nomad explorer[+2]##3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player . \n",
      "nomad explorer[+2]##the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad . \n",
      "usb 2.0[+2]##4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ). \n",
      "battery[+2]##5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace . \n",
      "battery life[+2]##6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's . \n",
      "look[+2],build[+2]##7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate . \n",
      "player[+2][p]##i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine . \n",
      "mediasource[+1]##8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ). \n",
      "##a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc. \n",
      "id3 tag[+1]##i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags . \n",
      "cd rip[+2]##b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive . \n",
      "sync[+3]##c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer . \n",

      "##i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning . \n",
      "play mode[+2]##10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter . \n",
      "pause[+2]##11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player \n",
      "storage[+2]##12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! \n",
      "##cons : \n",
      "plug and play[-1]##1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it . \n",

      "##this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags . \n",
      "##the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files . \n",
      "fm[-1],voice recording[-1]##4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras . \n",
      "accessory[-1]##5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing . \n",
      "##both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters . \n",
      "##a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary . \n",
      "case[-2]##6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed . \n",
      "##i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case . \n",
      "flip switch[+1]##7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch . \n",
      "##experience : \n",
      "##once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player . \n",
      "##this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) . \n",
      "##i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen . \n",
      "##also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates . \n",
      "##recommendations : \n",
      "##1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive . \n",
      "##2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one . \n",
      "##3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year . \n",
      "##4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. ) \n",
      "##5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped . \n",

      "##i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily . \n",

      "##4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much . \n",
      "##depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models . \n",
      "##nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews . \n",

      "picture[+3]##the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details . \n",
      "##a few things that might make it even better : \n",
      "indoor picture[-1]##1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance . \n",
